Generate an Rails app under the #folder:src with `<project-name>` entered and its type(e.g. Standard or API), follows the #file:rails-workflow.md and #file:requirements.md (if provided under #folder:src) as guidelines.
- Make a plan in order to implement the necessary features and functionality for the app see #file:requirements.md
- Break down the implementation into smaller tasks or steps, if some identified in #file:rails-workflow.md, try to use as a base specially for the `The test step` and `The commit step`.
- Once the plan is performed, it should be executed and detailed as requested, task by task and adjusted as necessary to ensure successful implementation.
